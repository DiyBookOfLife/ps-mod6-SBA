For this project, I created an e-commerce product management system using TypeScript and advanced JavaScript concepts. I used TypeScript to define structures for my data by typing class properties, constructor parameters, and function inputs. I applied object-oriented programming by creating a Product class that represents individual products and contains both the product data and related behavior. Methods like calculating the discounted price and displaying product details helped keep logic organized inside the class instead of spreading it throughout the program.

One challenge I encountered was making sure my code stayed clean and understandable while still satisfying TypeScript’s requirements. I focused on keeping my code simple and readable, using types where they were helpful and allowing TypeScript to infer types when possible. This helped me avoid unnecessary complexity while still maintaining type safety and structure in the project.

Another challenge was working with asynchronous operations when fetching data from the external products API. I used async and await to handle the API request and wrapped the logic in a try/catch block so errors could be handled without crashing the application. This made the flow of data easier to follow and ensured the program could respond properly if something went wrong during the fetch process.

I made a custom ValidationError class along with a centralized function to handle errors consistently. This allowed me to separate normal application errors from unexpected ones and display messages in the console. Overall, this project helped reinforce how TypeScript, object-oriented design, asynchronous programming, and error handling work together in a practical application.
